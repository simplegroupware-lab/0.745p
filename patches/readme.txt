1. submitted patches are put into folder '1_not_tested'
   they are basically not managed in this repository

2. once patches are tested by someone other than the author of the patch
   and sufficiently documented they are put into folder '2_tested'

3. if patches in folder '2_tested' are suitable for integration into 0.745p
   they will be integrated and then put into '3_integrated'
